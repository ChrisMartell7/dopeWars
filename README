About: 
	This is a game done for a user interface class at the Colorado School of Mines (Fall 2011). It is based upon the old school calculator game Dope Wars where you have 30 days to trade drugs and become a kingpin. You buy drugs in one city and then go to another city to sell them. It has facebook integration to allow users to communicate with others playing the game.
