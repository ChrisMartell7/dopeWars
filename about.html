<b>About</b>
This game is inspired by the 1984 game DrugWars by John E. Dell (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dope_Wars">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dope_Wars</a>)<br>
The object of the game is to make as much money as possible in 30 days. You start with $2,000 dollars that you borrowed from a loan shark. Use this money to buy dugs in one city and sell them for a profit in another. Be sure to pay back the loan shark, who is in the Bronx, because interest will acrue.<br><br>

<b>Changing Cities</b>
Because drug prices will not change unless you change cities, which takes a day to do, to make money you must go to different cities. To do this simply click on the drop down box in the game screen and select which city you would like to go to. Each city has a certain drug that is a higher and lower price.

<b>Buy / Sell Drugs</b>
To buy or sell drugs simply go to the drug section of the game screen, on the bottom left, and enter a quantity you would like to buy or sell. To make a purchase simply hit the buy or sell button. All items will be listed inside your coat.

<b>Guns & Police</b>
Guns are available in some cities. They will help protect you in case the police try to arrest you. If that is the case you will be given the option to run or fight. It is not smart to fight cops without guns.

<b>Score</b>
Your score is calculated simply, it is your current money minus any debt that you currently have.
